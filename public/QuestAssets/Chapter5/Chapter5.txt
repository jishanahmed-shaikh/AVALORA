Chapter 5: The Trickster's Infiltration

With the Emperor and his forces occupied by the Sentinel, and the network subtly compromised by Malgrave's schemes, the path was clear for the final piece of the initial assault. A figure slipped through the Citadel's weakened digital defenses, unseen and unheard.

He wore a fedora and a trench coat, his face hidden in shadow save for a menacing, permanent red grin. Smirk, the Cloaked Trickster, moved through the Citadel's systems like a ghost.

His purpose was not to fight, but to sabotage. He planted logic bombs in the armory's code, rerouted patrol routes, and, most importantly, made his way toward the chamber of the Gems of Eternity.

His mission was to find a flaw, a single crack in their containment field that could be exploited.

It was clever, elusive, and masked its presence with layers of deception. Before he could pinpoint the source, a critical alert flashed across his console.

The primary containment field for the central Gem had been destabilized from the inside.

A quiet, mocking laugh echoed through the network, audible only to him. Smirk had made his move. The heart of Avalora was now vulnerable.
