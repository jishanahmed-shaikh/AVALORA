Chapter 4: The Strategist's Gambit

Miles away, in a hidden sanctuary of code and shadow, Dr. Malgrave watched the chaos unfold. The Crimson Sentinel's rampage was a symphony of destruction, but it was merely the opening act. On his myriad screens, the real war was being waged in streams of corrupted data and fractured light.

With a flick of his fingers across a holographic interface, Malgrave released his true weapons. Not bombs or bullets, but viruses—digital predators designed to hunt and corrupt. They slipped into the Avalora blockchain, silent and unseen, a poison in the realm's digital bloodstream.

Back in the Citadel, the symphony of battle was interrupted by a discordant new sound: a piercing alarm. AVALANCH spun around at his console as the holographic display of the battlefield began to glitch, the image of the Sentinel fracturing into a thousand pieces.

"What is this?" AVAXIM demanded, his voice like thunder. "Report!" "It's the network," AVALANCH replied, his fingers flying across the controls. "There's a breach. A massive one. Communications are failing... the energy grid is fluctuating wildly!"

This was the second phase of the attack: psychological warfare. Malgrave hijacked the network, flooding the Avaloran warriors' comms with whispers of doubt and broadcasts of phantom defeats. Their helmet displays flickered with ghostly images of their comrades falling.

On the battlefield, confusion sowed chaos. A warrior, hearing a faked order to retreat, turned to flee, only to be cut down. Another stared at his helmet's display, seeing a vision of the Citadel in flames, his resolve crumbling. The brave defense against the Sentinel began to falter.

"The Sentinel... it was a distraction," AVALANCH said, his voice low with dawning horror. He traced the virus's signature through layers of firewalls, the digital trail leading back to one source. "It's Malgrave. He's inside our systems."

AVAXIM’s eyes narrowed. This was not a battle of steel, but of will. He strode to the Citadel's central data core, a pulsating pillar of light. Placing his hand upon it, he closed his eyes and poured his own energy into the network, a crimson tide to fight back the digital plague.

"Malgrave wages his war in the shadows," AVAXIM declared, his voice resonating with the power of the network. He and AVALANCH now stood before the main display, which was slowly stabilizing under their combined might. "Then we shall drag him into the light."
